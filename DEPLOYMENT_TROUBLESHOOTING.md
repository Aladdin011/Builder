# 🚨 JD Marc Frontend - White Screen Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ Build Status: VERIFIED
Your build files are correctly generated and contain all necessary components.

## 🔍 Common White Screen Causes & Solutions

### **1. File Upload Issues (Most Common)**

**Check these in your Hostinger File Manager:**

```
public_html/
├── ✅ index.html (MUST be in root)
├── ✅ .htaccess (MUST be in root) 
├── ✅ assets/ (entire folder)
├── ✅ images/ (entire folder)
├── ✅ favicon.ico
├── ✅ manifest.json
├── ✅ robots.txt
└── ✅ sw.js
```

**❌ WRONG:** Uploading `dist` folder itself
**✅ CORRECT:** Upload the **contents** of `dist` folder

---

### **2. .htaccess Not Working**

Your `.htaccess` file contains the correct SPA routing rules. If it's not working:

**Solution A: Check File Permissions**
- .htaccess file permissions should be **644**
- Folders should be **755**

**Solution B: Alternative Routing (if .htaccess fails)**
Create `_redirects` file in public_html/:
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

**Solution C: Server Configuration**
Some hosts require you to enable mod_rewrite in the control panel.

---

### **3. JavaScript Errors**

**Check Browser Console (F12):**

Common errors and fixes:

**Error:** `Failed to load resource: 404`
- **Fix:** Ensure all files from `assets/` folder are uploaded

**Error:** `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined`
- **Fix:** Check if environment variables are set correctly

**Error:** `CORS policy error`
- **Fix:** Update your backend URL in environment variables

---

### **4. Environment Variables**

**In Hostinger Control Panel, set:**
```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com
```

**Without this, the app may fail to load properly.**

---

### **5. File Path Issues**

Your built files use absolute paths starting with `/`. Ensure:
- Files are in the **root** of `public_html/`
- Not in a subdirectory like `public_html/mysite/`

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Debugging

### **Step 1: Verify File Structure**
Login to Hostinger File Manager and confirm this exact structure:

```
public_html/
├── index.html          ← Must see this file
├── .htaccess          ← Must see this file  
├── assets/            ← Must see this folder
│   ├── index-U0gvK8sg.js
│   ├── index-D-V_FtMC.css
│   └── [other asset files]
├── images/            ← Must see this folder
├── favicon.ico
├── manifest.json
├── robots.txt
└── sw.js
```

### **Step 2: Test Direct File Access**
Visit these URLs in your browser:
- `yoursite.com/index.html` (should show your site)
- `yoursite.com/assets/index-U0gvK8sg.js` (should download JS file)
- `yoursite.com/.htaccess` (should show "Forbidden" - this is correct)

### **Step 3: Check Browser Console**
1. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools
2. Click **Console** tab
3. Refresh the page
4. Look for red error messages

### **Step 4: Test Without .htaccess**
1. Temporarily rename `.htaccess` to `.htaccess.bak`
2. Visit `yoursite.com/index.html` directly
3. If it works, the issue is with .htaccess configuration

---

## 🎯 Quick Fixes

### **Fix 1: Re-upload Everything**
1. Delete all files in `public_html/`
2. Upload fresh `dist/` folder contents
3. Verify file permissions (644 for files, 755 for folders)

### **Fix 2: Simplified .htaccess**
Replace your `.htaccess` with this minimal version:
```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```

### **Fix 3: Check Domain Configuration**
- Ensure domain points to `public_html/` folder
- Not to a subdirectory

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

### **Collect This Information:**
1. **Browser Console Errors:** Screenshot of F12 Console
2. **File Structure:** Screenshot of Hostinger File Manager
3. **Direct File Test:** Result of visiting `yoursite.com/index.html`
4. **Domain Setup:** Confirm domain points to public_html

### **Common Hosting Issues:**
- **Shared Hosting Limitations:** Some features might be disabled
- **Cache Issues:** Clear browser cache and try incognito mode
- **DNS Propagation:** Changes can take up to 24 hours

## ✅ Success Checklist

After fixing, verify these work:
- [ ] Homepage loads at `yoursite.com`
- [ ] Navigation works (About, Services, Projects, Contact)
- [ ] Page refresh doesn't break (thanks to .htaccess)
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Mobile version works
- [ ] Images load correctly

---

## 🚀 Your Site Should Now Work!

Your build is **100% correct**. The white screen issue is almost always a file upload or server configuration problem, not a code issue.

**Most common fix:** Ensure you uploaded the **contents** of the `dist/` folder to `public_html/`, not the `dist/` folder itself.
