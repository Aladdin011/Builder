    content: `
      <p>Nigeria's infrastructure policy landscape is rapidly evolving, presenting unprecedented opportunities for sustainable development across Africa. As a leading construction company with deep roots in Nigeria and global reach, JD Marc has witnessed firsthand the transformative power of well-executed infrastructure policies.</p>
      
      <h2>The Current State of Infrastructure Policy</h2>
      <p>Nigeria's National Infrastructure Master Plan represents a comprehensive approach to addressing the country's infrastructure deficit. With an estimated $100 billion investment gap, the country is prioritizing strategic infrastructure development across transportation, power, water, and digital networks.</p>
      
      <h2>Key Policy Initiatives Driving Change</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF)</strong>: Focused on critical infrastructure projects</li>
        <li><strong>Nigeria Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP)</strong>: Emphasizing infrastructure as a growth driver</li>
        <li><strong>Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Framework</strong>: Enabling private sector participation</li>
        <li><strong>Regional Integration Projects</strong>: Connecting Nigeria with neighboring countries</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Lessons for Pan-African Development</h2>
      <p>Nigeria's experience offers valuable lessons for other African nations. The integration of local expertise with international standards, as demonstrated in JD Marc's projects, shows how African companies can lead continental infrastructure development.</p>
      
      <p>At JD Marc, we believe that effective infrastructure policy must balance economic growth with environmental sustainability and social inclusion. Our projects across Nigeria demonstrate how this balance can be achieved through innovative engineering and community engagement.</p>
