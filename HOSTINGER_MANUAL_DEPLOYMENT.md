# 🚀 JD Marc Construction - Manual Hostinger Deployment

## ❌ FTP Issue Resolution
Since automated FTP deployment is not working due to authentication issues, you can deploy manually using Hostinger's File Manager.

## 📦 Manual Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Files
✅ **COMPLETED** - Your website files are ready in the `dist/` folder
- Total size: **2 MB**
- Files: **8 files** (including assets)

### Step 2: Access Hostinger File Manager
1. **Login to Hostinger Control Panel**
   - Go to: https://hpanel.hostinger.com/
   - Login with your credentials

2. **Navigate to File Manager**
   - Click on **"Websites"** in the sidebar
   - Select your domain: **jdmarcng.com**
   - Click on **"Files"** → **"File Manager"**

### Step 3: Prepare Upload Directory
1. **Navigate to public_html**
   - In File Manager, open the `public_html` folder
   - This is where your website files need to go

2. **Backup Existing Files (if any)**
   - If there are existing files, create a backup folder
   - Select all files → Right-click → Move to backup folder

### Step 4: Upload Your Website

#### Option A: Upload Individual Files
1. **Navigate to your project's `dist/` folder on your computer**
2. **Select all files in the dist folder**:
   - `index.html`
   - `favicon.ico`
   - `placeholder.svg`
   - `robots.txt`
   - `assets/` folder (contains CSS and JS)
   - `images/` folder (contains images)

3. **Upload to Hostinger**:
   - In File Manager, click **"Upload Files"**
   - Select all files from your `dist/` folder
   - Upload them to the `public_html` directory

#### Option B: Create and Upload ZIP (Recommended)
1. **Create ZIP file**:
   - On your computer, go to the `dist/` folder
   - Select all contents inside the `dist/` folder
   - Right-click → "Compress" or "Add to ZIP"
   - Name it `jdmarc-website.zip`

2. **Upload ZIP to Hostinger**:
   - In File Manager, click **"Upload Files"**
   - Upload the `jdmarc-website.zip` file
   - After upload, right-click the ZIP file
   - Select **"Extract"** or **"Unzip"**
   - Extract to the current directory (`public_html`)
   - Delete the ZIP file after extraction

### Step 5: Verify Deployment
1. **Check File Structure**
   - Your `public_html` should now contain:
   ```
   public_html/
   ├── index.html
   ├── favicon.ico
   ├── placeholder.svg
   ├── robots.txt
   ├── assets/
   │   ├── index-COcj8o66.css
   │   ├── index-Coy6vRkp.js
   │   └── web-vitals-BrmGUrBx.js
   └── images/
       └── (image files)
   ```

2. **Test Your Website**
   - Visit: **https://jdmarcng.com**
   - The website should load properly
   - Test navigation and functionality

### Step 6: Post-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Website loads at https://jdmarcng.com
- [ ] All pages are accessible
- [ ] Images load correctly
- [ ] Contact forms work
- [ ] Mobile responsive design works
- [ ] No broken links

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Website Doesn't Load:
1. **Check index.html**: Ensure `index.html` is in the root of `public_html`
2. **File Permissions**: Make sure files have correct permissions (644 for files, 755 for folders)
3. **Domain Configuration**: Verify domain is pointed to hosting account

### If Images Don't Load:
1. **Check images folder**: Ensure the `images/` folder was uploaded
2. **Case Sensitivity**: Linux servers are case-sensitive
3. **File Paths**: Check that image paths in the code match uploaded files

### If CSS/JS Doesn't Load:
1. **Check assets folder**: Ensure `assets/` folder with CSS and JS files exists
2. **File Names**: Verify CSS and JS file names match what's referenced in `index.html`
